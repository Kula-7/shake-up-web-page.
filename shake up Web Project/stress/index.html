        <h2>Stress relief tips</h2>
      <p>
        Here are five tips that can help you relieve stress on a daily basis.
      </p>

      <h3 class="tips">Take a break from what you're doing</h3>
      <img src="../images/break.jpg" alt="" class="images" height="100px" width="150px">
      <p>
        Maybe it's hard to get away from a big work project, a crying baby or a
        growing credit card bill. But give yourself permission to step away from
        it for a short time. Don't avoid your stressors (those bills have to be
        paid sometime), but take a few minutes for yourself.
      </p>

      <h3 class="tips">Exercise on a regular basis</h3>
      <img src="../images/exercise.jpg" alt="" class="images" height="100px" width="150px">
      <p>
        Exercise is a huge part of being healthy, and it benefits your mind as
        well as your body. It doesn't have to be an hour a day; even a 20-minute
        walk in the midst of a stressful time can give you an immediate effect
        that can last for several hours.
      </p>

      <h3 class="tips">Take time to smile and laugh</h3>
      <img src="../images/smile.jpg" alt="" class="images" height="100px" width="150px">
      <p>
        When people are stressed, they often hold a lot of the stress in their
        face. Laughs and smiles can help relieve some of that tension and
        improve the situation. And if you share your smile with someone else, it
        will them release some of their tension too!
      </p>

      <h3 class="tips">Get support from family and friends</h3>
      <img src="../images/support.jpg" alt="" class="images" height="100px" width="150px">
      <p>
        Call a friend, send an email. Sharing your concerns does help relieve
        stress. But pick a person who you feel can understand you. If your
        co-workers are the stressors, it probably won't alleviate your stress if
        you share your worries over credit card bills with one of them.
      </p>

      <h3 class="tips">Meditate</h3>
      <img src="../images/meditate.jpg" alt="" class="images" height="100px" width="150px">
      <p>
        Meditation helps the mind and body to relax and focus. When meditating,
        people can release emotions that may have been causing the body physical
        stress. Research has shown that even meditating briefly can reap
        immediate benefits.
